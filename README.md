# Covid_app
Hi I am Harshit, I made this Covid app that shows total cases,active cases ,number of deaths and more,you can search for the country and see there total cases ,population and more.
It also shows a pie chart diagram of the above mentioned titles.I also used a shimmer effect when it is loading the information of all country.
